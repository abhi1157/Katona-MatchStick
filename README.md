# Katona-MatchStick
Katona style matchstick problems are the ones where you remove matchsticks in a given configuration of matchsticks to create n unit squares in the end. In the end, every matchstick is an edge to a unit square and these squares can be of any size that is 2x2 or 3x3 but for simplicity, we have kept the number of squares in final state to be 2 of every possible size.
